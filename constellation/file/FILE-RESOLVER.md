Name→UUID resolution with the precedence in [[DOC-NAME-RESOLUTION]] and a 60s LRU keyed by
`(project_id, kind)`, populated from the cached [[DATATYPE-WORKFLOW]]. Exposes
`resolveProject/Stage/Status/User/Label/Field/Task`; ambiguity throws an `ambiguous_*`
[[DATATYPE-MCP-ERROR]] with candidates; a miss throws `*_not_found` with close-match hints.
Invalidation hooks clear the relevant `(project,kind)` entry after a mutating op. See
[[FLOW-NAME-RESOLUTION]].
