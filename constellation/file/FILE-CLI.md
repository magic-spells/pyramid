Builds the `pyramid` command tree by walking [[FILE-OPERATIONS]]: each operation becomes a
`<group> <verb>` subcommand whose flags / positionals derive from its zod `input`. Parses argv
with a light parser (no heavy TUI dependency — keep the install MCP-only users carry small),
applies global flags ([[DATATYPE-CLI-OPTIONS]]) over the env config, invokes `operation.run`,
then hands the result — or a caught [[DATATYPE-MCP-ERROR]] — to the renderer (`src/cli/render.ts`)
which emits JSON or a human table and sets the process exit code per [[DOC-CLI-OUTPUT]].
Invoked by [[FILE-BIN]] for any argv whose first token isn't `mcp`.
